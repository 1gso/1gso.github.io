  <h1>Rubedo Capital</h1>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Rubedo, or reddening, is the final stage in the alchemical process. It symbolizes the completion and perfection of the Great Work.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Rubedo is often associated with the achievement of unity and balance, the merging of opposites, and the realization of the philosopherâ€™s stone. 
    This stage represents not just the physical transformation of substances, but also the spiritual and psychological transformation of the practitioner, achieving wisdom, harmony, and a perfected state.
